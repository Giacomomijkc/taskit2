# Node.js Backend Starter Template

This is a practical template for setting up your Node.js backend using popular technologies such as Express, Bcrypt, Cloudinary, Jsonwebtoken, and Mongoose.


## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get your backend up and running:

1) Clone this project to your local machine:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Giacomomijkc/backend-nodejs-template.git
```

2) Navigate to the project folder and initialize it by running:

```bash
  npm init -y
```

3) Install the required dependencies:

```bash
  npm install
```

4) Create an environment file (.env) in the project root directory and include the link to your MongoDB database. Add the following line to your .env file:

```bash
  MONGO_DB_URL="your-mongodb-url"
```
5) Start the server by running:

```bash
  npm run dev
```

Your Node.js backend is now up and running with all the configured technologies. You can start building your application on top of this template.
